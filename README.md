# Voices of PyLadies Manila

A web app showcasing the journeys of PyLadies Manila members, from their early days learning programming to their growth as experienced Python developers. This platform features audio clips of inspiring stories from Manila women Python devs of all ages and backgrounds, highlighting their experiences, challenges, and achievements in the Python community.

## About the Project

Voices of PyLadies Manila is dedicated to documenting women's experiences getting into programming and Python development in Manila. The website serves as a collection of everyone's personal stories and experiences, sharing the unique journeys of women from the time they learned programming, how they built their Python development skills, and what they are currently doing with Python today. Each audio clip represents a personal narrative of growth, challenges, and success in the tech field.

This project also exists to give us something fresh to collaborate on together, helping each other build our open-source contribution portfolio and skills.
