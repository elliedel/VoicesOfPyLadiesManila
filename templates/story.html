                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Maria, thank you for joining us today. Can you start by telling us about your background before you got into programming?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Of course! I actually have a degree in Biology from UP Diliman. I was working in a research lab for about three years, doing mainly data analysis on environmental samples. <span class="quote-highlight">I kept finding myself more excited about analyzing the data than collecting it</span>, and that's when I realized I might be more suited for a different path.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> That's fascinating. How did you make the transition from biology to programming?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Maria:</strong> It wasn't easy, I'll be honest. I started learning Python on my own because it was being used in the lab for some of our data analysis. I was amazed by how powerful it was ‚Äì I could automate tasks that were taking me hours to do manually. <span class="quote-highlight">Python felt like magic at first. I remember the first time I wrote a script that processed hundreds of data files in seconds instead of the days it used to take me.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> When did you decide to make programming your full-time career?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Maria:</strong> That decision took about a year of night classes and weekend coding. I was terrified, honestly. Here I was, a biology graduate trying to break into tech. <span class="quote-highlight">The imposter syndrome was real ‚Äì I felt like everyone would immediately know I didn't belong</span>. But I had built up a small portfolio of data analysis projects, and I decided to take the leap.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How did you find your first programming job?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Maria:</strong> I applied to dozens of junior developer positions. Most didn't even respond, which was discouraging. But eventually, I found a small startup that was looking for someone who could work with scientific data. My biology background actually became an asset there ‚Äì I understood the domain they were working in. That first job taught me so much about web development, APIs, and working in a team.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Tell us about finding the PyLadies Manila community.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Oh, PyLadies Manila changed everything for me! I discovered them about six months into my first programming job. I was still struggling with that feeling of not being a "real" programmer. <span class="quote-highlight">Walking into my first PyLadies meetup, I was nervous, but everyone was so welcoming. I realized I wasn't alone in feeling like an outsider sometimes</span>.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How has the community helped you grow?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Maria:</strong> In so many ways! The technical workshops helped me learn new skills, but more importantly, seeing other women who had made similar career transitions gave me confidence. I started mentoring newer members, which actually helped solidify my own knowledge. <span class="quote-highlight">Teaching others made me realize how much I had actually learned ‚Äì it was like proof that I really did belong in tech</span>.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What advice would you give to someone considering a similar career change?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Maria:</strong> First, don't let anyone tell you that you're too old or that it's too late to change careers. I started learning programming seriously when I was 28, and I'm now 32 and loving what I do. Second, <span class="quote-highlight">your previous experience isn't wasted ‚Äì it's actually your superpower. My biology background helps me approach problems differently, and that's valuable</span>. Finally, find your community. Whether it's PyLadies or another group, having support makes all the difference.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Any final thoughts for our listeners?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Just that <span class="quote-highlight">imposter syndrome never fully goes away, but it does get quieter. Even now, as a senior developer, I sometimes feel like I'm figuring things out as I go. But that's actually normal ‚Äì technology changes so fast that we're all constantly learning</span>. The key is to embrace that continuous learning and remember that your unique journey is what makes you valuable to any team.</p>
